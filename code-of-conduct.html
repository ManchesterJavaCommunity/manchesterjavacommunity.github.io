<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All attendees, sponsors, partners, volunteers and staff at our event are required to agree with the following code of conduct.
Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event.
We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.</p>

<h2 id="the_quick_version">The Quick Version</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our event is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, previous event attendance or computing experience (or lack of any of the aforementioned).
We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form.
Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate at any event venue, including hacks, talks, workshops, parties, social media and other online media.
Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund (if applicable) at the discretion of the event organisers.</p>

<h2 id="the_less_quick_version">The Less Quick Version</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
Photography is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed.
If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request.
It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
As this is a open conference we like to explicitly note that the talk content created at for this event are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.
Sponsors and partners are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.
In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.
Sponsor representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of event staff immediately.
Event staff will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.
We value your attendance.
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund (if applicable).
We expect participants to follow these rules at event venues and event-related social events.</p>
